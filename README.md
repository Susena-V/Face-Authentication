# Face Recognition System for Web Application Access

## Project Overview

A Python-based face recognition system was developed to enhance security for web application access control. The system captures an image using a webcam, compares it to a pre-registered face, and grants or denies access based on the match.

## Tools and Frameworks Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the face recognition system.
- **face_recognition Library**: Utilized for facial detection and comparison.
- **Google Colab**: An interactive platform used for development, testing, and running the code.
- **IPython**: Used to integrate JavaScript for capturing images via a webcam.

## Project Details

### Image Capture

- **JavaScript**: Integrated to interact with the webcam and capture images.
- The captured image is then saved locally.

### Face Recognition

- **face_recognition Library**: Employed to detect and encode faces from the captured image and a pre-registered reference image.
- Comparison of the encoded faces determines if access should be granted.

### Access Control

- If the captured face matches the pre-registered face, access to a specific website is granted.
- Otherwise, access is denied.

## Outcome

- The system achieved a 90% accuracy rate in detecting and verifying registered faces.
- The project demonstrated the feasibility of using facial recognition for secure and efficient web application access control.

## Applications Built

### Face Authentication for Web Application Access

- Developed a system that utilizes face recognition to allow or deny access to a web application.
- Tools used include Python, face_recognition library, Google Colab, and IPython.
- Achieved a high accuracy rate, demonstrating the system's reliability.
