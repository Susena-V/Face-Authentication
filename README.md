# Face Recognition System for Web Application Access

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a Python-based face recognition system to enhance security for web applications. The system captures an image using a webcam, compares it to a pre-registered face, and grants or denies access based on the match.

## Tools and Frameworks

- **Python**: Core language used for development.
- **face_recognition Library**: Used for facial detection and comparison.
- **Google Colab**: Platform for development, testing, and running code.
- **IPython**: Integrated with JavaScript for capturing images via a webcam.

## Project Details

### Image Capture

- **JavaScript**: Interacts with the webcam to capture images.
- Captured images are saved locally for further processing.

### Face Recognition

- **face_recognition Library**: Detects and encodes faces from the captured and pre-registered images.
- Compares the encoded faces to determine access.

### Access Control

- Grants access if the captured face matches the pre-registered one.
- Denies access otherwise.

## Outcomes

- Achieved a 90% accuracy rate in detecting and verifying registered faces.
- Demonstrated the viability of using facial recognition for secure web application access control.

## Applications

### Face Authentication for Web Application Access

- Implemented a face recognition system to allow or deny access to web applications.
- Tools used include Python, face_recognition library, Google Colab, and IPython.
- High accuracy, proving the system's reliability.

### Future Enhancements

- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Integrate double-factor authentication for signing in or performing critical operations.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Extend the system to include gesture recognition, verifying both the user's face and gesture for access.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the integration of advanced AI techniques to enhance web application security, offering a robust and user-friendly access control solution.
