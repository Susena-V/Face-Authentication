# Face Recognition System for Web Application Access

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a Python-based face recognition system to enhance security for web applications. The system captures an image using a webcam, compares it to a pre-registered face, and grants or denies access based on the match.

## Tools and Frameworks

- **Python**: Core language used for development.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application and handling requests.
- **face_recognition Library**: Used for facial detection and comparison.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for the front-end design of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the interaction with the webcam for capturing images.
- **VSCode**: Platform for development, testing, and running code.

## Project Details

### Image Capture

- **JavaScript**: Interacts with the webcam to capture images at regular intervals.
- Captured images are sent to the Flask backend for processing and are not stored locally.

### Face Recognition

- **face_recognition Library**: Detects and encodes faces from the captured images and the pre-registered image.
- Compares the encoded faces to determine access.

### Access Control

- Grants access if the captured face matches the pre-registered one.
- Denies access otherwise.
- A message is displayed to the user indicating the result of the access attempt.

## Outcomes

- Achieved a 90% accuracy rate in detecting and verifying registered faces.
- Demonstrated the viability of using facial recognition for secure web application access control.
- Developed a user-friendly interface with a welcoming design and responsive layout.

## Applications

### Face Authentication for Web Application Access

- Implemented a face recognition system to allow or deny access to web applications.
- The system utilizes Flask for backend processing, HTML/CSS for front-end design, and the face_recognition library for face detection.
- High accuracy and a user-friendly interface, proving the system's reliability.

### Future Enhancements

- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Integrate double-factor authentication for signing in or performing critical operations.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Extend the system to include gesture recognition, verifying both the user's face and gesture for access.
- **Database Integration**: Implement a database for managing user profiles and registration for easier scalability and management.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the integration of advanced AI techniques to enhance web application security, offering a robust and user-friendly access control solution. The use of Flask and modern web technologies facilitates a seamless user experience while ensuring reliable access control.
